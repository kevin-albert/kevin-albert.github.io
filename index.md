# Hello

My name is Kevin Albert. 
I'm a Software Engineer currently working on IoT / open office acoustical systems at Plantronics. 
Interested in machine learning, programming languages, Star Trek. 
I'm also a founding member of [Supple Congress](https://supple-congress.github.io/).
Occasionally, I post things here that I find amusing.
