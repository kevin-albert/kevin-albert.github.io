If you don't know, Quora is a question and answer site, intended to promote and facilitate meaningful discussion and learning or something. Some people apparently also use it to promote their broken startup companies.  

I recently encountered this question on Quora: *Who is the Deranged Cat?*.  

Being curious, I made the mistake of clicking on it. Turns out, the content of the question was literally just a link to someone's website that they were launching. It was a "guide to being a startup CTO", and supposedly included software engineering / cloud computing / business development tutorials.  

Ironically, every single page was broken due to some missing JSP file. Looks like a great place to learn about software development:

They replied one last time, and deleted everything right away.
